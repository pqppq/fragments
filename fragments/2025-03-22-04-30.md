### ðŸ¤” Why Choose Supervisor Over Other Options?

You might wonder why we use Supervisor instead of alternatives likeÂ [Systemd](https://systemd.io/),Â [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/), or containerized solutions likeÂ [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started). Hereâ€™s a quick comparison:

| Tools      | Pros                                                                     | Cons                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Supervisor | Simple setup, great for managing multiple processes, easy log management | Requires manual config                            |
| Systemd    | Native to Linux, faster startup                                          | More complex setup, harder to debug               |
| PM2        | Built for Node.js, supports process monitoring                           | Not ideal for Go applications                     |
| Docker     | Isolated environment, easy deployment, scalable                          | More setup overhead, requires container knowledge |

### When Should You Use Supervisor?
Use Supervisor when you want a simple, non-containerized way to manage a Go service, with features like auto-restart and log management, without dealing with systemdâ€™s complexity or Dockerâ€™s extra overhead.
