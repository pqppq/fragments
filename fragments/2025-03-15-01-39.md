> Sniprun is a code runner plugin for neovim written in Lua and Rust. It aims to provide stupidly fast partial code testing for interpreted **and compiled** [languages](https://michaelb.github.io/sniprun/sources/README.html#support-levels-and-languages) . Sniprun blurs the line between standard save/run workflow, jupyter-like notebook, and REPL/interpreters.

RustとかHaskellとかvirtual modeで選択した部分だけ実行できてとても良い
